  <h4>THE PURCHASE DID NOT GO THROUGH, BUT HAS IT MADE A RESERVATION ANYWAY?</h4>
  <p>If you have not received your order within (3-5 working days Sweden) or (5-10 working days (Mon-Fri) for the rest of the world) , you will receive a notice regarding the delay. It may be that one item had to be back-ordered or that we are experiencing slight delays due to a high workload at Nala.se.

  <h4>WHEN WILL I RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT FOR MY RETURN?</h4>
  <p>When you return something to us the refund is based on the payment method you chose for the original order. If you choose to pay with credit/debit card, the refund will be placed onto the same card. This money will usually be received within 2-3 banking days, but can take up to 6 bank days until it is available on your account.</p>
