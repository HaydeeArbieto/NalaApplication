  <h5>WHERE IS MY ORDER?</h5>
  <p>If you have not received your order within (3-5 working days Sweden) or (5-10 working days (Mon-Fri) for the rest of the world) , you will receive a notice regarding the delay. It may be that one item had to be back-ordered or that we are experiencing slight delays due to a high workload at Nala.se. If you have not yet received your order within 10 working days (Mon-Fri) after receiving a delivery update from us, kindly contact our customer service team.</p>
